html5-sikuli
============

Demo code for my [blog post](http://martinsdeveloperworld.wordpress.com/2013/11/04/testing-html5-canvas-applications-with-sikuli-and-arquillian/) about testing HTML5 canvas applications with sikuli.

To run the application you will have to download sikuli from [here](http://www.sikuli.org/download.html). Please copy the sikuli-java.jar into the folder html5-sikuli-webapp/lib. You 
may have to add the libs folder created by sikuli to your user path environment variable.

Your JBoss installation directory should be available through the environment variable JBOSS_HOME.
